This is a simple functional model for the RV32I ISA written in C++

To Build(rv32i_sim binary):
> make

It expects the rv32I binary to be present in 2 hex formatted ascii files:
code.txt => contains the instruction
data.txt => contains/represents the data memory

on successful execution of the program, it generates 2 output files:
data_out.txt => the data memory dump, at the end of execution
regs_out.txt => the register dump, at the end of execution
